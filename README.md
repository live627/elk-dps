## Introduction:
Stop users from double posting and bumping/spamming the topics. 

- Setup this mod at Administration Center » Add-on Settings » Miscellaneous.
- Removes Quick Reply if a bump is not allowed
  - Does NOT remove the 'Reply' buttons.
  - This is intentional and is set up to facilitate users receiving the error message, rather than asking (repeatedly) "Why can't I reply?"
- The applicable group threshold is the lowest in the user's groups.
  - Global moderators get 1 hour while newbies have 3 days to wait.
  - If a newbie is also a global moderator, then their wait time is 1 hour.
